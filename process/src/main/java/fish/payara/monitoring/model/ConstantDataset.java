/**
 * A special {@link SeriesDataset} for {@link Series} for only same value was observed so far.
 *
 * The main advantage over a {@link PartialDataset} is the low memory footprint and overall smaller object size for
 * values that do not change anyway. Should they change the {@link #add(long, long)} method returns a
 * {@link PartialDataset}.
 *
 * A minor second advantage is that the observed span can have any length and still be represented with just two points.
 * So in contrast to a {@link PartialDataset} which only has information for a fixed sliding time-frame the constant
 * nature allows the {@link ConstantDataset} to span any time-frame giving the user a more information while using less
 * resources.
 *
 * Last but not least the {@link ConstantDataset} does not risk to become {@link PartialDataset#isOutdated()}.
